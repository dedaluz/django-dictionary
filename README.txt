Django Dictionary App
======================

The Django Dictionary App is a simple means of displaying a list of items
ordered alphabetically. Useful for Martial Arts websites and education
articles where alphabetized lists are used often.


Installation
============

#. Add the `dictionary` directory to your Django App.

#. Run syncdb to install the dictionary model

Configuration
=============

#. None as of yet, but some are planned (see ToDo)

TODOs and BUGS
==============
#. Add configuration options such as: 
	* DD_SHOW_HITS_ONLY - Only show the alphabet items that have entries
	* DD_CLICKABLE - Will take the viewer to a more detailed view of the dictionary item
